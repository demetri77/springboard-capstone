## Statistics Questions

1) Get going by asking the following questions and looking for the answers with some code and plots:

  1. Can you count something interesting?
  2. Can you find some trends (high, low, increase, decrease, anomalies)?
  3. Can you make a bar plot or a histogram?
  4. Can you compare two related quantities? ?boxplot?
  5. Can you make a scatterplot?
  6. Can you make a time-series plot?

2) Having made these plots, what are some insights you get from them? Do you see any correlations? Is there a hypothesis you would like to investigate further? What other questions do they lead you to ask?
