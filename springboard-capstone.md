### College Score Card

At least 2 out of 5 Americans have a college degree. U.S. Labor Department statistics show that overall, college graduates today earn roughly 98% more per hour than people without a degree, it's no wonder Americans have been culturally taught to believe success in life requires a college degree. However, the average American is also in debt. The median student loan is [$17k](https://apps.urban.org/features/debt-interactive-map/) and more Americans owe student loans than car loans or a mortgage. Which colleges offer the best return, tuition/debt vs salary? Which factors from the College Score Card affect salary after attending?

**Is a college degree worth it?**

1. Cost of a degree
    + COSTT4_A: Average cost of attendance
    + RPY_1YR_RT: Fraction of repayment cohort with loan balances 1 year since repyament
    + CUML_DEBT_P90: Cumulative loan debt at the 90th percentile
2. Mean earnings vs Median earnings
    + MN_EARN_WNE_P10 vs MD_EARN_WNE_P10
3. Whether degree makes a difference in job search

### How effective are US prisons?

With at least 323 million people, [the US represents 4.4% of the world's population but houses 22% of its prisoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate). As such, the US also incarcerates more of its youth than any other country in the world in juvenile detention facilities. [In 2016, there were over 45,000 juveniles in detention facilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_detention_center#United_States). [There's an average of 36 violent crimes per 10,000 residents per state](https://www.santarosa-lawyer.com/united-states-crime-map-2017/). How much of our prisoners should remain in prison? What are the factors to preventing repeat offenders?
