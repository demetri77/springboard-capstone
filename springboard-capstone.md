### College Score Card

At least 2 out of 5 Americans have a college degree. As U.S. Labor Department statistics show that overall, college graduates today earn roughly 98% more per hour than people without a degree, it's no wonder Americans have been culturally taught to believe success in life requires a college degree. However, the average American is also in debt. The median student loan is [$17k](https://apps.urban.org/features/debt-interactive-map/) and more Americans owe student loans than car loans or a mortgage. Which colleges offer the best return, tuition/debt vs salary? Which factors from the College Score Card affect salary after attending?

### Don't be a menace to society

With at least 323 million people, [the US represents 4.4% of the world's population but houses 22% of its prisoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate). As such, the US also incarcerates more of its youth than any other country in the world in juvenile detention facilities. [In 2016, there were over 45,000 juveniles in detention facilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_detention_center#United_States). [There's an average of 36 violent crimes per 10,000 residents per state](https://www.santarosa-lawyer.com/united-states-crime-map-2017/). Is there a correlation between stress and crimes?
