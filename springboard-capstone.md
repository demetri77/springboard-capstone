### College Score Card

At least 2 out of 5 Americans have a college degree. U.S. Labor Department statistics show that overall, college graduates today earn roughly 98% more per hour than people without a degree, it's no wonder Americans have been culturally taught to believe success in life requires a college degree. However, the average American is also in debt. The median student loan is [$17k](https://apps.urban.org/features/debt-interactive-map/) and more Americans owe student loans than car loans or a mortgage. 

**Questions:**
1.  Which colleges offer the best return, tuition/debt vs salary? 
2.  Which factors from the College Score Card affect salary after attending?
3.  Is a college degree worth it? __advice: identify metrics that are objective__
4.  What is Value? Is it simply where Price meets Quality? Price is set, can Quality be determined by Earnings?

Variable Types of Interest
* COST
* EARNINGS
* REPAYMENT

1. Cost of a degree
    + COSTT4_A: Average cost of attendance per academic year
    + NPT4_PUB: Average net price for Title IV institutions (public institutions)
    + NPT4_PRIV: Average net price for Title IV institutions (private for-profit and nonprofit institutions)
    + RPY_1YR_RT: Fraction of repayment cohort with loan balances 1 year since repyament
    + CUML_DEBT_P90: Cumulative loan debt at the 90th percentile
2. Mean earnings vs Median earnings
    + MN_EARN_WNE_P10 vs MD_EARN_WNE_P10
3. Whether degree makes a difference in job search
    + Bureau of Labor Statistics, $400/week ($19k-21k/year) difference in earnings for degree holders

### Criminal Justice Reform

With at least 323 million people, [the US represents 4.4% of the world's population but houses 22% of its prisoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate). As such, the US also incarcerates more of its youth than any other country in the world in juvenile detention facilities. [In 2016, there were over 45,000 juveniles in detention facilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_detention_center#United_States). [There's an average of 36 violent crimes per 10,000 residents per state](https://www.santarosa-lawyer.com/united-states-crime-map-2017/). How much of our prisoners should remain in prison? What are the factors to preventing repeat offenders?

**How effective are US prisons?**
[Incarceration Report](http://time.com/4596081/incarceration-report/)

+ 2.3 million prisoners in the US.
+ 25% serve sentences for non-violent crimes
+ It costs $31,000 a year to keep a person in prison
+ Should public safety be the main reason for incarceration?
    1. criminal severity
    2. victim impact
    3. intent
    4. recidivism: tendency to reoffend
+ Major Crimes
    1. aggravated assault
    2. murder
    3. nonviolent weapons crimes
    4. robbery
    5. serious burglary
    6. serious drug trafficking
