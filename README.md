## Bank Marketing

**Problem**

There exists a bank that implements a telemarketing campaign to its customers. As a result the bank wants to predict who will successfully subscribe to a term deposit.   

The classification goal is to predict if a bank customer will subscribe a term deposit.


**Data**

The entire data set contains over 41,000 records with 21 attributes. Examining these attributes can help us predict which customer will subscribe to the term deposit.

More about the data set can be found here, [Bank Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) at UC Irvine's archive for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.
