## Start with some statistical analysis on your capstone data set

1) Get going by asking the following questions and looking for the answers with some code and plots:
    1. Can you count something interesting?
    2. Can you find some trends (high, low, increase, decrease, anomalies)?
    3. Can you make a bar plot or a histogram?
    4. Can you compare two related quantities?
    5. Can you make a scatterplot?
    6. Can you make a time-series plot?

2) Having made these plots, what are some insights you get from them? Do you see any correlations? Is there a hypothesis you would like to investigate further? What other questions do they lead you to ask?
## Submit a short report on your statistical analysis

Now let's write down our findings in a short document. This document will become part of your milestone report, and eventually your final project report.
Summarize the most interesting or important findings from your analysis in a short (2-3 page) document. You may use any format of your choice (R Markdown, Google Docs, Word etc)
